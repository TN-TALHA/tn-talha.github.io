      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hello! I'm Talha Shahzad, a dedicated student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at
        NCBA&E University. I'm deeply interested in web development and enjoy turning ideas into real, functional
        websites.
        My journey into tech began with curiosity and quickly grew into a passion for full-stack development. I enjoy
        learning new tools and technologies, especially in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm currently exploring how to
        build responsive and user-friendly websites.
        Outside of coding, I love working on creative projects, designing layouts, and always pushing myself to improve.
        I believe in learning by doing â€” and this portfolio is just the beginning.</p>
